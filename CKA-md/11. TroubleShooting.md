# CHAPTER 11: K8S TROUBLESHOOTING

## Troubleshooting your k8s cluster

### k8s api server
- Some error message will ocurr like bellow. since kubectl work depend on kube-api server.

![kubeApi-troubleshooting](https://github.com/hassj/CKA-acloudguru/blob/main/CKA-md/Image/kubeApi-troubleshooting.jpg "kubeApi-troubleshooting")

- Fixes: Making sure kubelete service and docker are up and running on your control plane node(s). 
- Fix: Making sure kube-config is set up correctly, this may mean the api-server is down.

### Checking node status
- Check nodes status to see if any of them experience issues.

`kubectl get nodes` ; ` kubectl describe node node_name`

> Notice at ``condition`` part in the output

### Checking k8s service
After checking status nodes and determine which issue node. just login to that node and checking the status of kubelete service

` systemctl status kubelete`

### Checking system pods
In case k8s cluster build from kubeadm. some of service components run as containers pods in the kube-system namespace. You may need to check it for detail

`kubectl get pods -n kube-system ` ; 'kubectl describe pod`

## Checking cluster and node log 

### Service logs
- You can check the logs for k8s-related services on each node using journalctl

`sudo journalctl -u kubelete` ; `sudo journalctl -u docker`

### Cluster component logs

- the log output usually residence in /var/log 

![log-output](https://github.com/hassj/CKA-acloudguru/blob/main/CKA-md/Image/log-output.jpg "log-output")

> kubeadm cluster contains running-service container, so log will not redirect to that local file system on node, in that case just access them with  `` kubectl logs `` command.

## Troubleshooting your applications
Normally, applications running on application services. so if have any issue for that apps. just checking status of pods for the first step.

### Checking pod status 
` kubectl get pods` ; ` kubectl describe pod pod_name`

### Running commands inside containers
- if you need to fix what is going on inside a container. just enter command inside that container with ``kubectl exec``

` kubectl exec podname -c container_name -- command `

- In case you need interact with container shell, 

` kubectl exec pod-name -c container_name --stdin --tty -- /bin/sh `

## Checking containers logs

### Container logs at high level
the container log will redirect to standard output and error stream.

### kubectl logs
`kubectl logs pod-name -c container_name`

## Troubleshooting k8s network issues

### kube-proxy and DNS
to components run as pod in kube-system namespace. You can check kube-proxy and dns service when troubleshooting issues related to network.

### tools for troubleshooting network netshoot
You can run a container that run inside cluster and run commands to test and gather information about network functionality. ``nikolaka/netshoot`` image.

```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: netshoot

spec:
  containers:
  - name: netshoot
    image: nicolaka/netshoot
	command: ['sh', '-c', 'while True; do sleep 5; done']

```

- enter to netshoot pod: ` kubectl  exec --stdin --ttyp -netshoot -- /sbin/sh	`
