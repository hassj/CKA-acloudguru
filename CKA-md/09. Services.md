# Chapter 9: K8s SERVICES

## Chapter 9.1: Overview

### What is a service?
- Provide a way to expose an application running on a set of Pods

- Service as a abstract layer which client just comunicate with service instead of comunicate with certain pod.

### Service Routing
contains load balancer for routing traffic from client to certain pod.

### Endpoint
it is backend entities to which services route traffic. A service that route traffic to multiple Pods, each Pod will have an endpoint associated with the service.	

## Chapter 9.2: Using k8s SERVICES

### Service types
Each service in k8s has a type. The type will determine how and where the service will expose your application.
there 4 types of services types:
cluster ip, nodeport, load-balancer, externalname (out of the scope of CKA)

### ClusterIP service
Exposing the application inside the cluster network, Use them when your clients will be another pod within cluster.
![ClusterIP](https://github.com/hassj/CKA-acloudguru/blob/main/CKA-md/Image/cluster-ip.jpg "cluster ip")

### NodePort services
Exposing application outside the cluster networks. use Nodeport when clients, user need to access application from outside the cluster.
![nodeport](https://github.com/hassj/CKA-acloudguru/blob/main/CKA-md/Image/nodeport.jpg "nodeport")

### Load balancer service
similar to cluster IP but they use an external cloud loadbalancer. This service only work with cloud platform supported load balancer.

### Hands-on Lab (Using K8s service)
1. Create a service manifest, by default type of service is cluserIP, you can leave out the line ``type`` if dont want

```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: svc-clusterip
spec:
  type: ClusterIP
  selector: 
    app: svc-example
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 80				// determine which port that service expose to listen on
      targetPort: 80		// which port that service will route traffic to on POD
```

- Listing endpoints that associate with service which have just created as above manifest.

` kubectl get endpoints <service_name> `

- Standing on another POD, you can check communicate to service as bellow command:
`kubectl exec pod_name -- curl service_name:port_number`

2. Creating NodePort service 
```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: svc-example
spec:
  type: NodePort
  selector:
    app: svc-example
  ports:
  - protocol: TCP
    port: 80
    targetPort: 80
    nodePort: 30080
```
> you can leave out line `` nodePort`` , k8s will automatic pick a random port for this.

## Chapter 9.3: Hands on Lab

## Chapter 9.4: Discovering k8s service with DNS 
### Service DNS names
format: 

``service_name.namespace-name.svc.cluster-domian.example``

> the default cluster domain is ``cluster.local``

### Service DNS and namespace
you can use this service dns to communicate between object in specific namespace normaly using fully qualify domain name.
`kubectl exec -n new_namespace new_pod_new_namespace -- curl different-service.default.svc.cluster.local`

## Chapter 9.6: Managing access from outside with k8s ingress
### what is an Ingress?
it is a k8s object, allow external access to service in the cluster. It have many more functionality than NodePort such as: ssl, name-based virtual host, load balancer...
![K8s Ingress](https://github.com/hassj/CKA-acloudguru/blob/main/CKA-md/Image/Ingress.jpg "K8s Ingress")

### Ingress Controller
Ingress in fact do nothing by themself, in order to do more functions need install one ore more  ingress controller.
There are variety of ingress controller supported in k8s platform.

### Routing to a service
Ingress defines a set of routing rules. 
Each rule has a set of paths, each with a backend. Request matching to a path will be routed to its associated backend.

In this example, a request to http://some-endpoint/somepath would be routed to port 80 on the my-service service.

```
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: my-ingress
spec:
  rules:
  - http:
      paths:
      - path: /somepath
        pathType: Prefix 
        backend:
          service:
            name: my-service
            port: 
              number: 80

```
### Routing to a service with a Named Port 
if service uses a named port, an ingress can also use port name to choose which port it will route to 
- service defination

```
apiVersion: v1
kind: service
metadata:
  name: my-svc
spec:
  selector:
    app: Myapp
  ports:
  - name: web
    protocol: TCP
	port: 8080
	targetPort: 8080
```

- Ingress defination.
```
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: ingress
metadata:
  name: my-ingress
spec:
  rules:
  - http:
      paths:
	  - path: /somepath
	    pathType: Prefix
		backend:
		  service:
		    name: my-svc			// using the name of service which you want to use
			port: 					
			  name: web				// using the name which defined at service manifest above
```
