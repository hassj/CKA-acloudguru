# Chapter 9: K8s SERVICES

## Chapter 9.1: Overview

### What is a service?
- Provide a way to expose an application running on a set of Pods

- Service as a abstract layer which client just comunicate with service instead of comunicate with certain pod.

### Service Routing
contains load balancer for routing traffic from client to certain pod.

### Endpoint
it is backend entities to which services route traffic. A service that route traffic to multiple Pods, each Pod will an endpoint associated with the service.	

## Chapter 9.2: Using k8s SERVICES

### Service types
Each service in k8s has a type. The type will determine how and where the service will expose your application.
there 4 types of services types:
cluster ip, nodeport, load-balancer, externalname (out of the scope of CKA)

### ClusterIP service
Exposing the application inside the cluster network, Use them when your clients will be another pod within cluster.

### NodePort services
Exposing application outside the cluster networks. use Nodeport when clients, user need to access application from outside the cluster.

### Load balancer service
similar to cluster IP but they use an external cloud loadbalancer. This service only work with cloud platform supported load balancer.
