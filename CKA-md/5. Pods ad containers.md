# Chapter 5: pods and containers 

## Chapter 5.1 Managing application configuration

### Application management

### configmaps
you can store configuration data in configmaps. Configmaps store data in the form key:values map. It can be passed to container application.
```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Configmap
metadata:
  name: my-configmap
data:
  key1: value1
  key2:
    subkey:
      morekeys: data
      evenmore: some data
  key3: |
    you can also do
    multi-line
    data.
```

### secret
```
apiVersion: 1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: my-secret
type: Opaque
data:
  secretkey1: user
  secretkey2: mypass

```
> value of secretkey1 and secretkey2 must encode as base64

### Environment variables 
- You can pass configmaps and secret to containers as Environment variable. These variable will be visible to your container at runtime 

- configuration volumes

### Demo


Generate an htpasswd file:

`htpasswd -c .htpasswd user_name`



Create a Secret containing the htpasswd data:

`kubectl create secret generic nginx-htpasswd --from-file .htpasswd`

Run the same command again using credentials (including the password you created at the beginning of the lab) to verify everything is working:

`kubectl exec busybox -- curl -u user:<PASSWORD> <NGINX_POD_IP>`

## Chapter 5.2 Managing container  resources
### Resource requests
allow you to define amount of resources (like cpu or memory) you expect container to use. this allows to scheduler avoid scheduling pods on node that do not have available resources.
```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: my-pod
spec:
  containers:
  - name: busybox
    image: busybox
    resources:
      requests:
        cpu: "250m"
        memory: "128Mi"
      limits:
        cpu: 500m
        memory: 254Mi
```

### Resource limits
determine the limitation of resource usage for containers, if usage higher than that limitation the container process will be stoped or terminated dependence on container runtime.
```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: my-pod
spec:
  containers:
  - name: busybox
    image: busybox
    resources:
      requests:
        cpu: "250m"
        memory: "128Mi"
      limits:
        cpu: 500m
        memory: 254Mi
```
> the unit of memory is Mi represent for Megabytes. units of cpu represent for 1/1000 of a cpu

## Chapter 5.3 Monitoring container health with probes

### what is container health

### Liveness probes
allow you to automatically determine whether an container application health is in health state or not. By default, k8s consider container is in down state when container's process is stoped.
Liness probes allow you to dertime exactly or customize this detection mechanism and make it more sophisticated.
```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata: liveness-pod
spec:
  restartPolicy: Never
  containers:
  - name: nginx-pod
    image: nginx:1.19.1
    #command: ["sh", "-c", "while true, do sleep 3600, done"]
    livenessProbe:
      httpGet:
        path: /
        port: 80
      initialDelaySeconds: 5
      periodSeconds: 5
      
```
### Startup probes
very similar to liveness probes, however startup probes just only run one time when the application startup. to ensure the application already started up.
Startup probes are especially useful for legacy applications that have long startup time.
```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata: startup-probe-pod
spec:
  restartPolicy: Always
  containers:
  - name: nginx-pod
    image: nginx:1.19.1
    startupProbe:
      httpGet:
        path: /
        port: 80
      failureThreshold: 30
      periodSeconds: 10
```
### Readinees probes
allows you to determine when the containr is already to accept request. if a service backed by mulitple containers or endpoint, the user traffic will not be sent to particular pod until its pass all the checking of readiness defined by rediness probes.
Use readiness probes to prevent traffic from being sent to pods while it is in starting up process.
```
apiVesion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata: rediness-pod
spec:
  restartPolicy: On-failure
  containers:
  - name: nginx-pod
    image: nginx:1.19.1
    readinessProbe:
      httpGet:
        path: /
        port: 80
      initialDelaySeconds: 5
      periodSeconds: 5
```
## Chapter 5.4 building self healing pods with restart policys

### what is restart policies
k8s can automatically restart the pod's container when they fail. Restart policy allows you to customize this behavior by defining when you want a pods container to automatically restart.
Restart policy is most important componnents of self-healing application, which automatically repair containers when problem arises.

### Always
It is default restart policy. it is always restart container if they stoped, no matter it completed successfully or not. Use this policy for application that should always be running.
```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata: startup-probe-pod
spec:
  restartPolicy: Always
  containers:
  - name: nginx-pod
    image: nginx:1.19.1
    startupProbe:
      httpGet:
        path: /
        port: 80
      failureThreshold: 30
      periodSeconds: 10
```

### Onfailure
It restart container when they fail with exist code error or the container is determined unhealthy by liveness probes. use this policy for applications need to run successfully then stop
```
apiVesion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata: rediness-pod
spec:
  restartPolicy: On-failure
  containers:
  - name: nginx-pod
    image: nginx:1.19.1
    readinessProbe:
      httpGet:
        path: /
        port: 80
      initialDelaySeconds: 5
      periodSeconds: 5
```

### Never
use this policy cause the pod's container to never be resrarted. No mater container exits or liveness probe fails. It use for application that should run once and never be restarted automatically.
```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata: liveness-pod
spec:
  restartPolicy: Never
  containers:
  - name: nginx-pod
    image: nginx:1.19.1
    #command: ["sh", "-c", "while true, do sleep 3600, done"]
    livenessProbe:
      httpGet:
        path: /
        port: 80
      initialDelaySeconds: 5
      periodSeconds: 5
      
```

## Chapter 5.5 Creating multi container pods

### What is multiple container Pod
- The pod have more than one container called multi-container pod.
- In a multi-container pod, containers share resources such as network, storage. They can interact with another one, working together to provides some functionality.

> best practice: Keep containers in seperate pods, unless they need to share Resources.

### cross container interaction

Containers sharing the same pod can interact with one another using shared resources:
- Networking: Containers share the same networking namespace also communicate with one another on any port although it is not exposed to cluster.
- storage: containers use volumes to share data in a pod.

### Example use cases
![cross container interaction](https://github.com/hassj/CKA-acloudguru/blob/main/CKA-md/Image/cross-container-interaction.jpg "cross container interaction")
You have an application that is hard-coded to send log to a file on disk. You add a secondary container (sidecar container) to reads that log from the shared volume then print out that log to console, so the log output will appeare in the container log.
```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata: sidecar-pod
spec:
  containers:
  - name: busybox
    image: busybox
    command: ["sh", "-c", "while true; do echo logs data > /output/output.log; sleep 5; done"]
    volumeMounts:
    - name: shared-vol
      mountPoint: /output
  
  - name: sidecar
    image: busybox
    command: ["sh", "-c", "tail -f /intput/input.log"]
    volumeMounts:
    - name: shared-vol
      mountPoint: /input/

  volumes:
  - name: shared-vol
    emptyDir: {}
```

## Chapter 5.7 Init Container

### Init Containers
![init container](https://github.com/hassj/CKA-acloudguru/blob/main/CKA-md/Image/init-container.jpg "init container")
- Init containers are containers run once during the startup process of a pod. A pod can have any init container and they will each run as ordered to completion.
- Init containers can perform variety tasks. they can contain, or use software, or setup scripts that are needed to main containers.
- They often useful in keeping main container lighter and more scure by offloading startup process tasks to seperate (main) containers.

### Use case of init containers
- cause a pod wait to k8s object created before finishing the startup process
- perform sensitive startup steps securly outside the pod 
- populate data into shared volume at startup
- communicate with another services at Startup
