# Chapter 2: K8S Architecture
## Architecture overview
Consist of control plane and worker nodes

### Control plane
controlling the cluster. control plane components can run on any machine in cluster, but usually are run on dedicated controller machines.

- etcd: it is k8s database, it store metadata configuration of whole k8s cluster. It provides high availability storage for all data relating to state of the cluster.
- Kube-API: primary interface for interacting with cluster or control plane
- kube-schedule: managing scheduling or process of selecting an available node for which running container
- kube-controller manager: run a collections of multiple controller in a single process. These controllers carry out a variety of automation related task within a cluster.
- Cloude controller manager: provides interface between k8s cluster and various cloud platform. It's only used when using cloud base resources alongside with k8s

### Worker node
- kubelet: is k8s agent work with control plane and ensure containers are run on nodes as instructed by control plane. It also handle process reporting to control plane about status of containers and other data related to containers.
- kube-proxy: running on each node, it is network proxy and handling some tasks related to providing networking between container and services in the cluster.
- container runtime: it is not built-in component of k8s, it is a seperate piece of software support for container run on. It support: docker and containerd 

## Installation 
- Now k8s support containerd, cri-o and some of difference type of cri-o
> note: should remmeber disable auto update OS on machine when running on prod environment.
- Configure on master node
```
mkdir -p $HOME/.kube/
cp -r /etc/kubernetes/admin.conf $HOME/.kube/config
sudo chown $(id -u):$(id -g) $HOME/.kube/config 
```	
- Building k8s cluster by kubeadm

## Namespace in K8S
k8s start with 4 namespaces maybe called as default Namespace:
- default
- kube-node-lease: this Namespace hold lease objects associated with node. kube-node-lease allow kubelete send heartbeat of each node to control plane so that use to detect node failure
- kube-public: this Namespace readable by all client
- kube-system: is Namespace container system objects created by K8S

` kubectl create namespace my-namespace`
