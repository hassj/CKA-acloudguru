### Control plane
controlling the cluster. control plane components can run on any machine in cluster, but usually are run on dedicated controller machines.

- etcd: it is k8s database, it store metadata configuration of whole k8s cluster. It provides high availability storage for all data relating to state of the cluster.
- Kube-API: primary interface for interacting with cluster or control plane
- kube-schedule: managing scheduling or process of selecting an available node for which running container
- kube-controller manager: run a collections of multiple controller in a single process. These controllers carry out a variety of automation related task within a cluster.
- Cloude controller manager: provides interface between k8s cluster and various cloud platform. It's only used when using cloud base resources alongside with k8s
