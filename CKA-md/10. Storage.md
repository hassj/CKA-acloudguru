# Chapter 10: STORAGE

## Chapter 10.1 Container file systems
The container file system is ephemeral. Files on the container's file system exist as long as the container exist.
If a container is deleted or recreated on k8s, the data stored on container's file system will be deleted.

## Chapter 10.2 Volumes
![Volume](https://github.com/hassj/CKA-acloudguru/blob/main/CKA-md/Image/storage.jpg "volume")

### Volumes and volumeMounts
```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: volume-demo
spec:
  containers:
  - name: my-pod
    image: nginx.1.19
    volumeMounts:
    - name: my-volume
      mountPath: /output
    
  volumes:
  - name: my-volume
    hostPath:
      path: /data
```

### sharing volume between containers
You can share same volume to multiple container within the same pod use volumeMounts

```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: my-pod
spec:
  containers:
  - name: first-container
    image: nginx.1.19
    volumeMounts:
    - name: my-volume
      mountPath: /output
  - name: second-container
    image: nginx.1.19
    volumeMounts:
    - name: my-volume
      mountPath: /input
  volumes:
  - name: my-volume
    emptyDir: {}
```

### Common Volumes types
There are many volumeTypes supported in k8s, but in CKA course just aware of two types bellow:
- hostPath: stores data in specific directory on local host k8s node
- emptyDir: stores data in dynamically way directory created on k8s node. this directory exist only as long as the pod exist on the node. The directory and data will be deleted when pod removed.
This volume type is very usefull when sharing data between containers in the same pod.

## Chapter 10.4 Persisten volumes
![Persistet Volumes](https://github.com/hassj/CKA-acloudguru/blob/main/CKA-md/Image/persistent-volumes.jpg "Persistent volumes")

### PersistentVolumes
- It is a k8s object, be treated as an abtract resource used by pod like compute 

```
kind: PersistentVolume
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: my-pv
spec:
  storageClassName: localdisk
  persistentVolumeReclaimPolicy: Recycle
  capacity:
    storage: 1Gi
  accessModes:
  - ReadWriteOnce
  hostPath:
    path: /var/output
```
####

``persistentVolumeReclaimPolicy`` property determines how the storage resources can be resused when the persistentVolume's associated PersistentVolumeClaim are deleted.

> note: the Recyle Reclaim policy is deprecated. K8s recommends using Dynamic provisioning instead.

- Retain: Requiere administrator to manually clean the data then prepare the storage resource for reuse.

- Delete: Delete underlying resource automatically (usually used in cloud storage resource)

- Recycle: Automatically delete data in the storage resource then prepare the storage resource for reuse.

### Storage classes

- StorageClassName will refer to storage class object that used by amdinstrator to specific types of service using in platform.

```
apiVersion: storage.k8s.io/v1
kind: StorageClass
metadata:
  name: localdisk
provisioner: kubernetes.io/no-provisioner
allowVolumeExpansion: true
```

``allowVolumeExpansion`` property determines whether or not the storageClass supports the ability to resize the volumes after they are created.

ex:

```
apiVersion: storage.k8s.io/v1
kind: StorageClass
metadata:
  name: slow
provisioner: kubernetes.io/no-provisioner

```

or another storageclass with high perfomance:

```
apiVersion: storage.k8s.io/v1
kind: StorageClass
metadata:
  name: fast
provisioner: kubernetes.io/no-provisioner
```
> You dont need to create storageClass, it will be created automatically when define PVC but the ``allowVolumeExpansion`` do not set to true.

### PersistentVolumesClaims
that's represent user request for storage resource. It defines a set of attributes similar to those of PersistentVolume
```
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: my-pvc
spec:
  storageClassName: localdisk
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  resources:
    request:
      storage: 100Mi
```

### Using a PersistentVolumesClaim in a Pod
PVC can be mounted in pod like another volume. 
```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: pod-pvc
spec:
  containers:
  - name: my-pod
    image: busybox
    volumeMounts:
    - name: my-volume
      mountPath: /output
  volumes:
  - name: my-volume
    persistentVolumeClaim:
      claimName: my-pvc     // use exactly name defined in pvc manifest
```

### Resizing a PersistentVolumesClaim
You can expand PVC without interupting applications that are using them.
simply edit `` spec.resource.request.storage`` attribute of an existing PVC, increasing its value.

Just notice that storageClass must allow resize functionality.

#### Using pvc hands-on lab
![Using Persistet Volumes](https://github.com/hassj/CKA-acloudguru/blob/main/CKA-md/Image/persistentVolume.jpg "Using Persistent volumes")

`` Available`` that means pv is not bount to a pvc any, and ready to be bound to any pvc when match.
