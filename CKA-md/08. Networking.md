# CHAPTER 8: NETOWRKING

## Chapter 8.1: K8s Networking Architecture overview

### K8s Network model 
It is set of standard define how networking between pods behaves

### Network model Architecture
Each pod have unique ip address, dont use same ip addr. Each pod can reach other pod by pod's ip.
Network model will create virtual network that allow Pods easily communitcate with each other, regardless of which Node they are on.

## Chapter 8.2: CNI plugin overview
### CNI plugins
That are a type of k8s network plugin.

### Selecting network plugin
this course use calico network plugin, which already installed in k8s. If not intalled network plugin yet, k8s will hang on at not ready  state.

### Install CNI plugin

## Chapter 8.3: Understanding K8S DNS
- K8s DNS will allow pods can locate other pod via name service instead of pod ip
- kubeadm use coredns service
- pod domain name: ``pod-ip-addr.namespace-name.pod.cluster.local``

> exmaple: 192.168.10.10.defaul.pod.cluster.local

## Chapter 8.4: Using Network policies  

### what is a network policy?
- That is a k8s object that allows you to control the flow of network between pods.
- This allows you to build more secure cluster network by keeping pods isolated from traffic they do not need 

### Pod selectors
- By default pod created with opening to all communication, it means that pods are considered not isolated. After applied the network policy to pod, it will be isolated as policy defined.
- Pod selector determines which pod in the namespace the NetworkPolicy applied. Pod selector can select the pod using labels.
```
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: my-network-policy
spec:
  podSelector:
    matchLabels:
      role: db
```

### Ingress and Egress
NetworkPolicy can apply to both ingress and egress or both of them.

- ingress talk about incomming traffic to specific pod from other sources
- egress talk about outgoing traffic leaving the pod for another destination.

### from and to Selectors
- From selector will select ingress traffic (incomming) that will be allowed
- To selector: select engress traffic (outgoing) that will be allowed.

```
---
spec:
  ingress:
  - from:
    - ipBlock:
        cidr: 192.168.10.0/24 
```

```
spec:
  ingress:
  - from:
    - podSelector:
	    matchLabels:
		  app: db 
---

spec:
  ingress:
  - from:
    - nameSpaceSelector:
        matchLabels:
          app: db		
```

### Port

specify one or more ports that will allow traffic
```
---
spec:
  ingress:
  - from:
    ports:
      - protocol: TCP
        port: 80 
```
### Hands on lab
```
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: my-network-policy
  namespace: my-np
  lables:
    app: nginx
spec:
  podSeclector:
    matchLabels:
      app: nginx
  policyTypes:
  - Ingress
  - Egress
  ingress:
  - from: 
    - nameSpaceSelector:
      matchLabels:
        team: my-np
    ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 80
```
